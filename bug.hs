This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function `safeHead` to get the first element of a list, but it fails to handle the empty list case properly, leading to a runtime error. 

```haskell
-- Incorrect implementation
safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead [] = Nothing  -- Correct
safeHead (x:_) = Just x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myList = []
  case safeHead myList of
    Just x -> print x
    Nothing -> print "Empty List"

  let myList2 = [1,2,3]
  case safeHead myList2 of
    Just x -> print x
    Nothing -> print "Empty List"
```

The error occurs when `safeHead` is called with an empty list.  While the `safeHead [] = Nothing` case is correct, a more robust way is to use pattern matching to handle the potential exception or error.
